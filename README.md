# ChatServerClient
Create a group chat server that clients will connect to. The client should have the option of sending a private message, by specifying who they want to send a message to. The client should be able to send an encrypted private message using a OneTimePad, by specifying who they want to send a message to and that they intend to encrypt or decrypt it.
